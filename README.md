# Titanic Survival ‚Äî Basic Prediction Model

This repository contains a **baseline survival prediction model for Titanic passengers**, built entirely without machine learning.  
It uses manually calculated group survival probabilities combined with feature importance weights to estimate survival likelihood.

This is **Version 1** of a planned two-part project. The current version offers a basic, interpretable approach to prediction  
and will later be expanded with numerical features and machine learning techniques.

## ‚öôÔ∏è Method Overview

1. **Group Statistics**: Computes average survival rates for each category (e.g. `Sex`, `Pclass`, etc.)
2. **Feature Weighting**: Calculates how strongly each feature influences survival based on rate spread
3. **Prediction Scoring**: Combines weighted probabilities into a survival score
4. **Thresholding**: Applies the optimal classification threshold learned from training data

## üìä Model Accuracy

- **Training Accuracy**: ~79.91%  
- **Kaggle Leaderboard (Public Test Set)**: ~76.55%

Accuracy is based on predicting survival labels (`0` or `1`) using calculated scores and threshold optimization.
